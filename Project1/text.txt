Boxing (also known as "Western boxing" or "pugilism") is a combat sport in which two people,
usually wearing protective gloves and other protective equipment such as hand wraps and mouthguards,
throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring.
Although the term "boxing" is commonly attributed to "western boxing", in which only the fists are involved,
boxing has developed in various ways in different geographical areas and cultures. In global terms, boxing is a set of combat sports focused on striking,
in which two opponents face each other in a fight using at least their fists, and possibly involving other actions such as
kicks, elbow strikes, knee strikes, and headbutts, depending on the rules. Some of the forms of the modern sport are western boxing,
bare knuckle boxing, kickboxing, muay-thai, lethwei, savate, and sanda.Boxing techniques have been incorporated into many martial arts,
military systems, and other combat sports.
While humans have fought in hand-to-hand combat since the dawn of human history, the earliest evidence of any type of boxing can be seen in Sumerian carvings
from the third and second millennia BC.The earliest evidence of boxing rules date back to Ancient Greece, where boxing was established as an
Olympic game in 688 BC. Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights, largely in Great Britain, to the forerunner of modern boxing in the
mid-19th century with the 1867 introduction of the Marquess of Queensberry Rules.
Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth Games sport and is a standard fixture in most international games — it also has its own world championships.
Boxing is overseen by a referee over a series of one-to-three-minute intervals called "rounds".
A winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when a referee deems an opponent incapable of continuing, disqualifies of an opponent,
or the resignation of an opponent. When the fight reaches the end of its final round with both opponents still standing, the judges' scorecards determine the victor.
In case both fighters gain equal scores from the judges, a professional bout is considered a draw. In Olympic boxing, because a winner must be declared,
judges award the contest to one fighter on technical criteria.

England
English wine is growing in popularity and is increasingly recognised as a premium wine-producing region, with more than 450 wineries and around 3.15m bottles produced a year.
The most popular grapes varieties grown in English vineyards are Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Bacchus, as well as Pinot Meunier and Ortega.
Whilst vineyards are found across the whole of England, the climate of the South and South East makes it a particularly popular region for growing vines, especially in Hampshire,
Sussex and Kent.
2018 saw a bumper harvest, with yields doubled in some vineyards.
English sparkling wine
In December 2015, Champagne Taittinger announced it was buying a vineyard in Kent and would produce an English sparkling wine.
English sparkling wine specifically has been highly praised for its quality, collecting three Platinum and six Gold medals in the 2018 Decanter World Wine Awards.
